## Datasheet

The focus of this lab is to write a driver for the on-board IMU (LSM6DS3) on the Arduino nano 33 IOT board. Writing the driver software will require careful reading of the LSM6DS3 datasheet.

You can find the datasheet [here](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/lsm6ds3.pdf).

The datasheet is quite long, but the comments given in the skeleton code will narrow down the pages you have to read on order to finish each task.
